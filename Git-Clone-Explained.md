Git Cloning
===========

CLONING refers to the practice of making an exact copy of an existing repository on your local machine. So far this would seem to be most used when working on someone else's project: you create a duplicate of their files so that you can have the most up-to-date code, in its most complete form. However, depending on your workflow you might also clone your own repo if you have initialised the directory elsewhere (for example, Github), and then clone it to your local machine for further development.
