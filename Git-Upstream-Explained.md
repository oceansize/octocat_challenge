Git Upstream
============

UPSTREAM is generally used to refer to activity that moves in the direction of the externally-hosted repository (as opposed to downstream, which would apply to cloning, or downloading).

The -u flag can be used when pushing your repo, to tell Git you want it to presume that for each time you type 'git push', you intend the destination for these commits to remain the same. If you wish to push to a diferent origin, you must then specify in in full.
